This project is aimed to design and program a fully autonomous rover-like vehicle. Any updates will be posted on this Repo.
The rendering below was the first design that I constructed before moving on to a 3D printed chassis. The Chassis on this rendering was to be contructed of balsa wood due to its low weight.
